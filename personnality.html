	<p class="caption">Those are the 5 most valuable personnality traits you have according to me:</p>

	<h4>1. Your Humour</h4>
</section>
<section class="child">
	<p>It's true, you have the best humour in the world (not only "hit it hit it", event if it makes me laugh a lot). Everytime I talk with you, you always find a way to make me smile and laugh. Even if I'm probably the only one that understand it, your humour is a major part of me falling in love with you. </p>

		<h4>2. Miss Know-It-All</h4>
	</section>
	<section class="parent">
		<p>In the National History Museum, I told you I didn't like "Mr. know-it-all" and you told me your were one. The difference however is that you actually do know it all. You teach me a lot, even without noticing, which I do find very attractive. Never doubt about yoursel because you are smarter than you think. </p>

	<h4>3. My Own Book-Worm</h4>
	</section>
	<section class="child">
		<p>By now this has been established: you love to read books. A lot, like <b>a lot</b>. Good thing is I love that about you. It does not really impact our relationship directly, but I just deeply love knowing you do what you like to and I can't wait to have the largest bookshelves with a ladder to reach the top in our future home. </p>

		<h4>4. Your Presence </h4>
	</section>
	<section class="parent">
		<p>As I said previously, everytime I talk with you, I'm the happiest man on Earth. However, it goes beyond that. The simple fact of having you next to me fill my life your joy and comfort. It always pushes me to be the best I can and I have never been more happpier than when I'm with you. Soon enough, I'll have you next to me everyday.</p>

	<h4>5. The Overall Human being You Are</h4>
	</section>
<section class="child">
	<p>I said I was going to write the 5 most valuable traits of your personnality I value in you. However, only taking 5 is definitely not enough as your are simply perfect to me. You are the prettiest, kindest, birghtest young woman I met and I want to call you mine forever and beyond that. I love you so much.</p>
